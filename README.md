BEFORE USING this program, open a cmd in the project folder and run "pip install -r requirements.txt".

The included "start.bat" file can be used to start the software.

Small script to set the current calendar as the windows background. 

You need a folder in which you have to put the pdfs. You don't need to delete or rename them, the program will only take the latest pdf.
In main.py change “path” to whatever you prefer.

I suggest putting this folder in a safe space and creating a symbolic link of "start.bat" in the same folder you use for pdfs.
